# Tasks Module

## Overview
The `tasks` module in the AgenticAI Framework manages the creation, scheduling, and execution of tasks for AI agents. It provides a structured way to define workflows, assign responsibilities, and track progress.

## Key Classes and Functions
- **Task** — Represents a single unit of work with metadata and execution logic.
- **TaskScheduler** — Schedules tasks for execution at specific times or intervals.
- **TaskQueue** — Manages a queue of pending tasks.
- **execute_task(task_id)** — Executes a task by its identifier.
- **list_tasks(status=None)** — Lists tasks filtered by their status (pending, in-progress, completed).

## Example Usage
```python
from agenticaiframework.tasks import Task, TaskScheduler

# Define a task
task = Task(name="Data Processing", description="Process incoming data files.")

# Initialize scheduler
scheduler = TaskScheduler()
scheduler.add_task(task)

# Execute tasks
scheduler.run_pending()
```

## Use Cases
- Automating repetitive workflows.
- Scheduling periodic data processing jobs.
- Coordinating multi-step AI agent operations.
- Tracking the status of long-running processes.

## Best Practices
- Keep task definitions modular and reusable.
- Use descriptive names and metadata for easier tracking.
- Handle task failures gracefully with retries or fallbacks.
- Monitor task execution times to identify bottlenecks.
